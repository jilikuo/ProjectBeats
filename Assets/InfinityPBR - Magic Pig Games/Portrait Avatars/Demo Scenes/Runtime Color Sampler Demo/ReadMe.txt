IMPORTANT: I highly suggest you only import this demo in a NEW PROJECT with ONLY the Portrait Avatars and Runtime Color Sampler packages installed.

This demo shows how to use Portrait Avatars together with Runtime Color Sampler.

So...it requires Runtime Color Sampler :)

Please install both packages before extracting this package.
